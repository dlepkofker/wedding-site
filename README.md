# Wedding Site

A wedding website crafted specifically for my fianc√©e and I's wedding but designed to be somewhat customizable for others. It features a NodeJS backend, Express middleware, and React front end with Chakra UI for styling. 

## Development and Build

Install dependencies in `/`, `/client`, and `/server` with `npm i`.

Additionally, ensure you have webpack and gulp installed.

Build the project in root folder with `gulp`, and access your built zip in the resulting `/build` directory.
